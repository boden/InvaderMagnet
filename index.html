        <h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>You have likely found this page because you scanned the QR code visible on a Space Invader-shaped magnet like the one shown in the picture below. On this page, you will find some information on the background of this project and all necessary files and instructions to create an InvaderMagnet yourself. How cool is that? ;)</p>

<h3>How to create one</h3>

<p>In order to create an InvaderMagnet, you will need access to a 3D printer. If you don't happen to own one, you can look for one in a local FabLab or Hackerspace, or you can have the model printed by an external service provider such as shapeways.com or sculpteo.com.</p>

<p>In the repository, you find several files for printing (you can download them all by clicking on the folders on top of the page): </p>

<ul>
<li>InvaderMagnet.3dm is the model in Rhino's file format</li>
<li>InvaderMagnet.wrl is a plain file of the model without texture</li>
<li>InvaderMagnet.zpr is a textured version of the InvaderMagnet for printing on a Zprinter color 3D printer</li>
<li>QRcode.png is the image of the QR code that links to this site</li>
<li>QRtexture.png is an image with the QR code that fits the front of the model</li>
</ul><p>Obviously, in order to print in color, you will need a color 3D printer, which can be quite hard to get your hands on. If you can only print one-colored, you need to add the QR code yourself. Just print it on a sticker or glue it to the invader.</p>

<p>In order to make the Invader magnetic, you will need to glue a small magnet (5mmx5mmx5mm) into the hole on the back of the model. We have used small neodymium magnets which worked quite well.</p>

<h3>Background Idea</h3>

<p>The InvaderMagnet was created by <a href="https://github.com/sdraxler" class="user-mention">@sdraxler</a> and <a href="https://github.com/boden" class="user-mention">@boden</a> for the BarCamp in Siegen 2012 (<a href="http://barcamp-siegen.de/">http://barcamp-siegen.de/</a>), as a small giveaway for our session on 3D printing. It was designed and printed at the HCI lab of the University of Siegen (<a href="http://www.uni-siegen.de/fb5/">http://www.uni-siegen.de/fb5/</a>)</p>

<p>The idea was to create a small, useable object in order to show the potentials of the new technology. The QR code was added to provide a link for interested users to find out how such an object can be created.</p>

<p>The shape of a Space Invader was chosen because it was the logo of the Hackerspace Siegen (<a href="http://www.hasi.it">www.hasi.it</a>) which cooperated with us for the occasion of the Barcamp. </p>

<p>The design is based on the great 8bit Space Invader Ornaments created by jglauche on Thingiverse (<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5084">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5084</a>), and licensed under the Attribution-Share Alike-Creative Commons license (CC BY-SA).</p>
