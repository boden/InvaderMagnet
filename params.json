On this page, you will find some information on the background of this project and all necessary files and instructions to create an InvaderMagnet yourself. How cool is that? ;)\r\n\r\n![A picture of an InvaderMagnet](http://boden.github.com/InvaderMagnet/images/invader.png)\r\n\r\n###How To Create One\r\n\r\nIn order to create an InvaderMagnet, you will need access to a 3D printer. If you don't happen to own one, you can look for one in a local FabLab or Hackerspace, or you can have the model printed by an external service provider such as [Shapeways](www.shapeways.com) or [Sculpteo](sculpteo.com).\r\n\r\nIn the repository, you will find several files for printing (you can download them all by clicking on the folders on top of the page): \r\n\r\n* **InvaderMagnet.3dm** is the model in Rhino's file format\r\n* **InvaderMagnet.wrl** is a plain file of the model without texture\r\n* **InvaderMagnet.zpr** is a textured version of the InvaderMagnet for printing on a Zprinter color 3D printer\r\n* **QRcode.png** is the image of the QR code that links to this site\r\n* **QRtexture.png** is an image with the QR code that fits the front of the model\r\n\r\nIn order to print in color, you will obviously need a color 3D printer, which can be quite hard to get your hands on. If you can only print one-colored, you need to add the QR code yourself. Just print it on a sticker or glue it to the invader.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the Invader magnetic, you will need to put a small magnet (5mmx5mmx5mm) into the hole on the back of the model. We have used small neodymium magnets and some superglue, which worked quite well.\r\n\r\n###Background Idea\r\n\r\nThe InvaderMagnet was created by @sdraxler and @boden for the [BarCamp in Siegen 2012](http://barcamp-siegen.de/) as a small giveaway for our session on 3D printing. It was designed and printed at the [HCI lab of the University of Siegen](http://www.uni-siegen.de/fb5/).\r\n\r\nThe idea was to create a small, functional object in order to show the potentials of the new technology. The QR code was added to provide a link for interested users to find out how such an object can be created.\r\n\r\nThe shape of a Space Invader was chosen because it was the logo of the [Hackerspace Siegen](www.hasi.it) which cooperated with us for the occasion of the Barcamp. \r\n\r\nThe design is based on the great 8bit Space Invader Ornaments created by jglauche on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5084), and licensed under the Attribution-Share Alike-Creative Commons license (CC BY-SA).\r\n\r\n###Contact\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact us under sebastian.draxler@uni-siegen.de, or alexander.boden@uni-siegen.de.\r\n\r\nAll texts, images and models on this site are licensed as CC BY-SA by Sebastian Draxler and Alexander Boden, 2012 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).","google":"","tagline":""}
