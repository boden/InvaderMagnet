On this page, you will find some information on the background of this project and all necessary files and instructions to recreate an InvaderMagnet yourself. How cool is that? ;)\r\n\r\n![A picture of an InvaderMagnet](http://i.imgur.com/7jUGs.jpg)\r\n\r\n###Create Your Own InvaderMagnet(s)\r\n\r\nIn order to create an InvaderMagnet, you will need access to a 3D printer. If you don't happen to own one, you can look for one in a local FabLab or Hackerspace, or you can have the model printed by an external service provider such as [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com) or [Sculpteo](http://www.sculpteo.com). Just upload the InvaderMagnet.wrl file to one of their online shops when you want to have one printed this way.\r\n\r\nIn the repository, you will find several files for printing (you can download them all by clicking on the folders on top of the page): \r\n\r\n* **InvaderMagnet.3dm** is the model in Rhino's file format\r\n* **InvaderMagnet.wrl** is a plain file of the model without texture\r\n* **InvaderMagnet.zpr** is a textured version of the InvaderMagnet for printing on a ZPrinter color 3D printer\r\n* **QRcode.png** is the image of the QR code that links to this site\r\n* **QRtexture.png** is an image with the QR code that fits the front of the model\r\n\r\nIn order to print in color, you will obviously need a color 3D printer, which can be quite hard to get your hands on. If you can only print one-colored, you need to add the QR code yourself. Just print it on a sticker or glue it to the front of the invader.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the Invader magnetic, you will need to put a small magnet (a 5mm cube) into the hole on the back of the model. We have used small neodymium magnets and superglue, which worked quite well.\r\n\r\n###Background Idea\r\n\r\nThe InvaderMagnet was created by Sebastian Draxler and Alexander Boden for the [BarCamp in Siegen 2012](http://barcamp-siegen.de/) as a small giveaway for our session on 3D printing. It was designed and printed at the [HCI lab of the University of Siegen](http://www.uni-siegen.de/fb5/).\r\n\r\nThe idea was to create a small, functional object in order to show the potentials of the new technology. The QR code was added to provide a link for interested users to find out how such an object can be created.\r\n\r\nThe shape of a Space Invader was chosen because it was the logo of the [Hackerspace Siegen](http://www.hasi.it) which cooperated with us for the occasion of the Barcamp. If you are interested in 3D printing, hacking and playing with technology, look at their site or visit their place.\r\n\r\nThe design is based on the great [8bit Space Invader Ornaments](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5084) created by jglauche on Thingiverse, which are licensed under the Attribution-Share Alike-Creative Commons license (CC BY-SA).\r\n\r\n###Contact\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments, feel free to mail to sebastian.draxler@uni-siegen.de, or alexander.boden@uni-siegen.de.\r\n\r\n_All texts, images and models on this site are licensed as [CC BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) by Sebastian Draxler and Alexander Boden, 2012._","name":"InvaderMagnet","tagline":"","google":""}
